## Project Overview

- The Pizza Sales Project aims to analyze and visualize sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain.

- It utilizes SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for data visualization.

- The goal is to provide insights to help the pizza restaurant chain optimize operations, improve sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Components

- **Data Acquisition:** Start by acquiring raw sales data from database. This data may include pizza_id,  order_id, pizza_name_id, quantity, order_date, order_time, unit_price, total_price, pizza_size, pizza_category, pizza_ingredients, pizza_name.

- **Data Transformation with SQL:** Use SQL to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into an analysis-friendly format. Tasks may include aggregating data, handling values, and creating calculated fields.

- **Data Analysis:** Write SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis. Examples include identifying top-selling pizza flavors, analyzing sales trends over time, evaluating customer demographics, calculating average order values, and assessing restaurant performance.

- **Power BI Visualization:** Create interactive visualizations using Power BI. These may include bar charts, pie charts, time series charts, geographic maps, and dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **Insights and Recommendations:** Based on the analysis and visualizations, provide actionable insights to the pizza restaurant chain.
